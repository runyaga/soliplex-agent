/// merging with client-side tools, and returning a [ToolRegistry] with
/// executor closures that may capture Riverpod `ref` internally (opaque
/// to the runtime).

///   var registry = const ToolRegistry();
///   for (final tool in room.clientTools) {
///     registry = registry.register(tool);
///   }
///   return registry;
/// };
